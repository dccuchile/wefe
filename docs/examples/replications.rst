Previous Studies Replication
===============================

All replications of other studies that WEFE has currently implemented are in the Examples folder. 

Below we list some examples:

Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases (WEAT)
======================================================================================

The following 
`notebook <https://github.com/dccuchile/wefe/blob/master/examples/WEAT_experiments.ipynb>`__ 
reproduces the experiments performed in the following paper:

    Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases.
    Aylin Caliskan, Joanna J. Bryson, Arvind Narayanan


.. note:: 

  Due to the formulation of the metric and the methods to transform the word to embeddings, 
  our results are not exactly the same as those reported in 
  the original paper. However, our results are still very similar to those 
  in the original paper.

A transparent framework for evaluating unintended demographic bias in word embeddings (RNSB)
============================================================================================

The following 
`notebook <https://github.com/dccuchile/wefe/blob/master/examples/RNSB_experiments.ipynb>`__ 
replicates the experiments carried out in the following paper:

    Chris Sweeney and Maryam Najafian.
    A transparent framework for evaluating unintended demographic bias in word embeddings.
    In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 1662â€“1667, 2019.

.. note:: 

  Due to the formulation of the metric (it trains a logistic regression in 
  each execution) our results are not exactly the same as those reported in 
  the original paper. However, our results are still very similar to those 
  in the original paper.

  This code is not executed when compiling the documentation due to the long 
  processing time. 
  Instead, the tables and plots of these results were embedded.
  The code is available for execution in the following `notebook <https://github.com/dccuchile/wefe/blob/master/examples/RNSB_experiments.ipynb>`__.
