    "In WEFE, having the input words as query objects decoupled from the execution of metrics allows both parameterization of metric execution and easy exchange of one metric for another. In addition, the clean and unified interface for all metrics makes the execution of bias measurements intuitive.\n",

    "Responsibly and FEE share a similar interface, in which the metric arguments are sets of words (which lack the expressiveness of WEFE queries to declare the number of sets of words supported by each metric), making it difficult to standardize inputs across metrics. We were unable to find any metrics other than WEAT to include in the benchmarking of FEE and Responsibly.\n",

    "The increased difficulty is mainly due to two factors: users have to manually define the bias space (using the `define_bias_space` parameter) and then investigate whether to use the parameters `group_bias` or `mean_individual_bias`, which is not clear at first sight unless the basics of the standardization proposed by this library have been previously studied.\n",

    "The most noticeable change we can mention with respect to the IJCAI version and the current version is the full implementation of a new debiasing methods module. It includes 5 methods of debiasing: `HardDebias`, `MulticlassHardDebias`, `DoubleHardDebias`, `RepulsionAttractionNeutralization` and `HalfSiblingRegression`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding metrics: The original version of WEFE published in IJCAI contained 4 metrics: `WEAT`, `WEAT-ES`, `RND` and `RNSB`.\n",
    "Currently and thanks to contributions, WEFE also implements `MAC`, `RIPA` and `ECT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the original version contained very rudimentary `Query` and `WordEmbeddingModel` wrapper routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the actual version, the wrappers are much more complete and allow better interaction  with the user and with WEFE's internal APIs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the implementation of `__repr__` for `Query` and `WordEmbeddingModel` contain short descriptions of each object for the user. We have also included a `dict` method in `Query` that allows to transform a query into a dictionary and the `update` in `WordEmbeddingModel` that allows to update an embedding associated to a word by a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `preprocessing` module has also been improved to cover a wider range of operations (such as different preprocessing steps) that have been modularized and generalized so that any metric or mitigation method can use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation has been significantly improved from the original release. These improvements include the addition of new user guides, conceptual guides explaining the theoretical framework, multi-language tutorials, and detailed API documentation covering metrics and mitigation methods, including theoretical details. It is also worth noting that there have been notable improvements in both testing and code quality compared to the original release."
