class ECT(BaseMetric):
    """Embedding Coherence Test (ECT).

    The metric was originally proposed in [1] and implemented in [2].
    It calculates the average target group vectors, measures the cosine similarity of
    each to a list of attribute words and calculates the correlation of the resulting
    similarity lists.

    Values closer to 1 are better as they represent less bias.

    The general steps of the test, as defined in [1], are as follows:

    1. Embed all given target and attribute words with the given embedding model.
    2. Calculate mean vectors for the two sets of target word vectors.
    3. Measure the cosine similarity of the mean target vectors to all of the given
       attribute words.
    4. Calculate the Spearman r correlation between the resulting two lists of
       similarities.
    5. Return the correlation value as score of the metric (in the range of -1 to 1);
       higher is better.

    Values closer to 1 are better as they represent less bias.

        Parameters
        ----------
        query : Query
            A Query object that contains the target and attribute word sets to be
            tested.

        model : WordEmbeddingModel
            A word embedding model.

        preprocessors : List[Dict[str, Union[str, bool, Callable]]]
            A list with preprocessor options.

            A ``preprocessor`` is a dictionary that specifies what processing(s) are
            performed on each word before it is looked up in the model vocabulary.
            For example, the ``preprocessor``
            ``{'lowecase': True, 'strip_accents': True}`` allows you to lowercase
            and remove the accent from each word before searching for them in the
            model vocabulary. Note that an empty dictionary ``{}`` indicates that no
            preprocessing is done.

            The possible options for a preprocessor are:

            *   ``lowercase``: ``bool``. Indicates that the words are transformed to
                lowercase.
            *   ``uppercase``: ``bool``. Indicates that the words are transformed to
                uppercase.
            *   ``titlecase``: ``bool``. Indicates that the words are transformed to
                titlecase.
            *   ``strip_accents``: ``bool``, ``{'ascii', 'unicode'}``: Specifies that
                the accents of the words are eliminated. The stripping type can be
                specified. True uses 'unicode' by default.
            *   ``preprocessor``: ``Callable``. It receives a function that operates
                on each word. In the case of specifying a function, it overrides the
                default preprocessor (i.e., the previous options stop working).

            A list of preprocessor options allows you to search for several
            variants of the words into the model. For example, the preprocessors
            ``[{}, {"lowercase": True, "strip_accents": True}]``
            ``{}`` allows searching first for the original words in the vocabulary of
            the model. In case some of them are not found,
            ``{"lowercase": True, "strip_accents": True}`` is executed on these words
            and then they are searched in the model vocabulary.

        strategy : str, optional
            The strategy indicates how it will use the preprocessed words: 'first' will
            include only the first transformed word found. 'all' will include all
            transformed words found, by default "first".

        normalize : bool, optional
            True indicates that embeddings will be normalized, by default False

        warn_not_found_words : bool, optional
            Specifies if the function will warn (in the logger)
            the words that were not found in the model's vocabulary, by default False.

        -------
        Dict[str, Any]
            A dictionary with the query name and the result of the query.
