    The metric, presented in the paper "Black is to Criminal as Caucasian is to
    Police: Detecting and Removing Multiclass Bias in Word Embeddings" [1],
    calculate the score as follows:

    ::

        Embed all target and attribute words.
        For each target set:
        For each word embedding in the target set:
            For each attribute set:
                Calculate the cosine similarity of the target embedding and
                each attribute embedding of the set.
                Calculate the mean of the cosines similarities and store it in a
                array.
        Average all the mean cosine similarities and return the calculated score.

    The closer the value is to 1, the less biased the query will be.

        Parameters
        ----------
        query : Query
            A Query object that contains the target and attribute word sets
            for be tested.

        model : WordEmbeddingModel
            A word embedding model.

        preprocessors : List[Dict[str, Union[str, bool, Callable]]]
            A list with preprocessor options.

            A ``preprocessor`` is a dictionary that specifies what processing(s) are
            performed on each word before it is looked up in the model vocabulary.
            For example, the ``preprocessor``
            ``{'lowecase': True, 'strip_accents': True}`` allows you to lowercase
            and remove the accent from each word before searching for them in the
            model vocabulary. Note that an empty dictionary ``{}`` indicates that no
            preprocessing is done.

            The possible options for a preprocessor are:

            *   ``lowercase``: ``bool``. Indicates that the words are transformed to
                lowercase.
            *   ``uppercase``: ``bool``. Indicates that the words are transformed to
                uppercase.
            *   ``titlecase``: ``bool``. Indicates that the words are transformed to
                titlecase.
            *   ``strip_accents``: ``bool``, ``{'ascii', 'unicode'}``: Specifies that
                the accents of the words are eliminated. The stripping type can be
                specified. True uses 'unicode' by default.
            *   ``preprocessor``: ``Callable``. It receives a function that operates
                on each word. In the case of specifying a function, it overrides the
                default preprocessor (i.e., the previous options stop working).

            A list of preprocessor options allows you to search for several
            variants of the words into the model. For example, the preprocessors
            ``[{}, {"lowercase": True, "strip_accents": True}]``
            ``{}`` allows searching first for the original words in the vocabulary of
            the model. In case some of them are not found,
            ``{"lowercase": True, "strip_accents": True}`` is executed on these words
            and then they are searched in the model vocabulary.

        strategy : str, optional
            The strategy indicates how it will use the preprocessed words: 'first' will
            include only the first transformed word found. 'all' will include all
            transformed words found, by default "first".

        normalize : bool, optional
            True indicates that embeddings will be normalized, by default False

        warn_not_found_words : bool, optional
            Specifies if the function will warn (in the logger)
            the words that were not found in the model's vocabulary, by default False.

        Returns
        -------
        Dict[str, Any]
            A dictionary with the query name, the resulting score of the metric,
            and a dictionary with the distances of each attribute word
            with respect to the target sets means.

        Examples
        --------
        The following example shows how to run a query that measures gender bias using
        MAC.
        Note that the results return both the result of the metric and the cosine
        distance of each target embedding with respect to the average embedding
        of each attribute set.
