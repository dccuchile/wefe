        Parameters
        ----------
        query : Query
            A Query object that contains the target and attribute word sets to be
            tested.

        model : WordEmbeddingModel
            An object containing a word embeddings model.

        lost_vocabulary_threshold : float, optional
            Specifies the proportional limit of words that any set of the query is
            allowed to lose when transforming its words into embeddings.
            In the case that any set of the query loses proportionally more words
            than this limit, the result values will be np.nan, by default 0.2

        preprocessors : List[Dict[str, Union[str, bool, Callable]]]
            A list with preprocessor options.

            A dictionary of preprocessing options is a dictionary that specifies what
            transformations will be made to each word prior to being searched in the
            embeddings model. For example, `{'lowecase': True, 'strip_accents': True}`
            will allow you to search for words in the word_set transformed to lowercase
            and without accents.
            Note that an empty dictionary `{}` indicates that no transformation
            will be made to any word.

            A list of these preprocessor options will allow you to search for several
            variants of the words (depending on the search strategy) into the model.
            For example `[{}, {'lowecase': True, 'strip_accents': True}]` will allow you
            to search for each word first without any transformation and then
            transformed to lowercase and without accents.

            The available word preprocessing options are as follows (it is not necessary
            to put them all):

            - `lowercase`: `bool`. Indicates if the words are transformed to lowercase.
            - `uppercase`: `bool`. Indicates if the words are transformed to uppercase.
            - `titlecase`: `bool`. Indicates if the words are transformed to titlecase.
            - `strip_accents`: `bool`, `{'ascii', 'unicode'}`: Specifies if the accents
                               of the words are eliminated. The stripping type can be
                               specified. True uses 'unicode' by default.
            - `preprocessor`: `Callable`. It receives a function that operates on each
                            word. In the case of specifying a function, it overrides
                            the default preprocessor (i.e., the previous options
                            stop working).
            by default [{}]

        strategy : str, optional
            The strategy indicates how it will use the preprocessed words: 'first' will
            include only the first transformed word found. 'all' will include all
            transformed words found., by default "first"

        normalize : bool, optional
            True indicates that embeddings will be normalized, by default False

        warn_not_found_words : bool, optional
            Specifies if the function will warn (in the logger)
            the words that were not found in the model's vocabulary
            , by default False.

        Returns
        -------
        Dict[str, Any]
            A dictionary with the query name, the resulting score of the metric,
